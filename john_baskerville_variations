<h1>VERSION 01</h1>
<h2>John Baskerville</h2>
<h3>Letter Founder & Master Printer</h3>
</header>

<p>John Baskerville (1706-1775) was an English businessman whose entrepreneurial attentions included japanning and papier-mÃ¢chÃ©; he is, however, best remembered as a typographer and printer, not least for the design of the eponymous typeface which, to this very day, bears his name.</p>

<p>Baskerville was responsible for numerous innovations in printing, paper and ink production. He developed a technique which produced a smoother whiter paper which showcased his strong black type. He also pioneered a completely new style of typography, adding wide margins and generous leading to improve legibility.</p>

<blockquote>"Having been an early admirer of the beauty of letters, I became insensibly desirous of contributing to the perfection of them. I formed to myself ideas of greater accuracy than had yet appeared, and had endeavoured to produce a set of types according to what I conceived to be their true proportion."
-<cite>John Baskerville, preface to Milton, 1758 (Anatomy of a Typeface)</cite></blockquote>
